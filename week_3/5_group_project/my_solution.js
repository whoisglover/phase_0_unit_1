//Test 1:
// I want to create a mini program called sum.

//Test 2:
// I have list of numbers.  The list contains an odd amount of numbers. I want the sum program to add all of these up and tell me what the sum is.

//Test 3:
// I have list of numbers.  The list contains an even amount of numbers. I want the sum program to add all of these up and tell me what the sum is.

//Test 4:
// I want to create a new mini program called mean.

//Test 5:
// I have the same list of numbers that is odd from case 2 and I want mean to give me the average of these numbers.

//Test 6:
// I have the same list of numbers that is even from case 3 and I want mean to give me the average of these numbers.

//Test 7:
// I want to create a new mini program called median.

//Test 8:
// I want the mini program median to give me the median value of a list of numbers with an odd amount.

//Test 9:
// I want the mini program median to give me the median value of a list of numbers with an even amount.
