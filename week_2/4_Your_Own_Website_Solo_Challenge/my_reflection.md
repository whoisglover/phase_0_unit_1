# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
  * I learned that less is more.  The sites that I really enjoyed using had very simple but well designed user interfaces.  I used this ideology while redesigning my index page.  I went with a high definition image that took up the entire page and designed simple boxes on top of it.  I also learned that using a color scheme really helps a sites design and I used the same yellow and grey throughout my site.  I really like the effect of using the yellow for link hovers.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  * I really like design and user experience, but I don't feel very confident in my artistic abilities.  I'm hoping something I will learn at DBC is how to be a better designer.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  * My process was to create a plan and wireframe and then move to code.  The plan helped give me direction but I didn't stick to it 100%.  I used trial and error while creating the CSS rules.  This let me try different colors and spacing in real time.  The previous excercise with chrome dev tools also really helped me with this.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  * I would like to add some javascrip to make the site more interactive.  I would like to have drop down lists that expand and shrink.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  * It wasn't very difficult to apply the material but I was surprised by how much time it took to actually code my site. I started working on the code and got very involved in where things should go and what color they should be and before I knew it 4 hours had gone by.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
