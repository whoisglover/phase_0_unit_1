##QUIZ
* **Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.**
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
   * Elements tab lets you change your HTML and CSS in realtime and see the changes on the page.  You can even save your changes locally or revert changes you have made.  If you are happy with your changes you can use 'Save as..' to overwrite your HTML or CSS files permanently.
  * **Javascript Debugging**
   * Profiles tab lets you collect Javascript CPU Profile to see which javascript functions are slowing down the browsers fps.  The network tab lets you see which Javascript calls are taking the longest and how much minifying them can save your page load time.  Finally the console will let you debug Javascript by giving you a terminal to run javascript and see what is being produced.  You can then inspect those elements and make changes to fix the bugs.
  * **Performance Optimization**
   * Most performance optimization is done through the network tab.  Viewing the page download tree can show you which elemetns are slowing down your pages load time.  This can provide valuable information and suggest optimizations, like combining javascript files.  Profiles tab can also help with optimization through the Javascript CPU profile previously mentioned or using Heap Snapshot to track down memory leaks that may be slowing down your page.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
 <br> Command+Option+I or Command+Shift+C (for element inspector).  These quick keys have been giving me trouble so the usual way I get to dev tools quickly is just inspecting a random element and then navigating to the tab I want.

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
