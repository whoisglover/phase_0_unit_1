# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	* I think web standards are extremely important.  There needs to be baseline standards while developing so you can know that your page or content will reach as many people (screen sizes) as possible.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	* The standard structure makes sense to me.  I've had practice with setting sizes to percentages instead of exact pixels and I really liked the responsiveness that brings.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	* The new HTML5 elements just make sense.  If you are always making a div called header, footer, nav why not just make these standard tags.  I hope this creation of standard tags continues as HTML progresses in the future.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	* reset.css is necessary in case you don't use any custom css, the device or browser that your page is being viewed on has its own base css to give elements a basic look (links are blue, etc).  The problem is this can vary from device or browser so reset overrides this base css and makes sure youre page is always rendered the way you expected.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	* I have used almost every browser including IE, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. I see big differences in look AND feel between these browsers. Personally I've become so used to Chrome's look and feel that it really bugs me to use anything else.  Honestly I don't think this is a good thing, and it would certainly make developers lives easier if there was more standardization in how pages appear in different browsers.
