# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
  * My biggest time management challenge is completing all the Phase 0 material alongside a full course load at the University of Missouri.  I am taking 15 hours of upper level computer science courses and they are all proving to be quite difficult. 
* How will you combat that? 
  * One thing I did to try to help get through such a busy class schedule and have time for DBC was quit my job last week.  Already having the 15 extra hours of free time per week has really helped me stay on track.  I have exactly one month left of school so once the semester ends I am confident I will be able to give DBC my full attention.   
* What techniques will you try? 
  * A positive mindset has proven to be the best technique so far.  Instead of obsessing over how busy I am or how hectic my week is I now simply accept the fact that my life is moving at an extremely fast pace right now and I can handle that.  I like to think of it as rising to the occasion.  I have raised the bar on what my normal week looks like in terms of workload and output and no longer waste time stressing about how I wasn't always this busy.  
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
  * My overall plan is to schedule almost every minute of my day between school and DBC. Without realizing I've been using the technique of timeboxing. I have been blocking off chunks of time early in the week to work on phase 0 content and it has helped a lot.  Specifically, having a good planner that I use regularly has helped a lot with this scheduling.  Also I plan on really diving deeper into the content of DBC once I am done with school.  For now I am simply doing what is required and not much extra research or reading.  That being said I have been amazed at how much I've learned in these first two weeks.
